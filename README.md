  <h2> OVERVIEW </h2>
<p align="justify"> This project is an example of character animation but  with the help of human motion capture data. This could be considered a step in analyzing and imagining how non-living things could walk or could depict different types of movements when applied with human captured mocap data. It is about the character named "cookie" which is a flour sack. It is an example of how motion capture data could be applied to 3D model of a non-living object. For this project, flour sack has been choosen as the non-living object and developed into a character named cookie.The final result is the video of the mapped mocap data to the 3D model. It involved following steps <br><ol><li><p align="justify">Recording the mocap data.</li> <li><p align="justify">Modelling the 3D character Using 3D Modelling Software.</li><li><p align="justify">Unwrapping the UV's of the model.</li><li><p align="justify">Texturing the Model: Providing a colth like texture to the model.</li><li><p align="justify">Rigging the model : Providing skeleton to the model. </li><li><p align="justify">Retargeting: Mapping the bvh(motion capture data) to the 3D model.</li><li> <p align="justify">Rendering: Rendering the file in 3D software for getting video out of it.</li></ol><h5>MOCAP RECORDING</h5> <p align="justify">The movements were recorded while imagining that the subject is walking along the edges and diagonal of an imaginary square. The movements that were recorded were usual human walking, walking with crossed legs, walking in reverse as well as forward directions respectively. Besides, walking with long steps in horizontal direction was also considered. The tempo of walking ws also changed from time to time to check how brain reacts to unusual movements(movements that brain is not used to on regular basis)<h5>STORY OF COOKIE</h5> <p align="justify">The cookie is a flour sack who is bored of lying down for months in a warehouse so he tries to explore the human world. So, he starts by practicing simple walking in his warehouse.The movements that he will be doing is in actuality the recorded human motion capture data. </p>
  <h2> SOFTWARES USED </h2>
  <p align ="justify"><ol><li>Motive was utlized for recording the motion capture data.</li><li>Blender was used for creating the 3D model and for other purposes like texturing, rigging, retargeting and rendering. </li></ol> Here's the link to the website for dowloading blender is: <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/" download>Download here</a></p>
  <h2> GUIDELINES FOR THIS PROJECT</h2>
 <p align-"justify"> Dowload the file provided in the link and you will be able to use it. Install blender before viweing the files.Link to download the file is:<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13GMl4DRk7c9c1MG5_g-CxQi2Dl3Ym-K_/view?usp=share_link" download>Download Here</a></p>
 <h2>HOW TO USE THIS </h2>
 <p align="justify">The Final Project Folder contains three different folders. The folder blend files contains blender files and texture files for 3D character cookie. First blender file is of non-rigged 3D model.The other two blender files are of same rigged 3D model but are retargeted differently.To view these files , open them in blender, click on the rig and go to pose mode. In the constraints tab, you will be able to view the bone constraints. There will be two types of constraints in the constraints tab: one is rotation constraints and the other one is stretch to constraints. The rotation constraints are those that are mapped to bvh file. The other stretch to constraints are for the rig, try not to change stretch to constraints, because it will deform the rig structure.<ol><li><p align="justify">If you want to try different rig then use nonrigged blend file from that folder.In that case of you have to create your own rig.</li><li><p align="justify">You can also use rigged blend files and delete bone cone rotation constraints and try different constraints and try different types of bone mapping to get the best movement results from cookie.</li><li><p align="justify">You can also use your own mocap file and retarget any type of movement to the rigged models. Use either motive or rokoko for recording mocap data. You can use other options too or you can download motion capture file from mixamo or any other website. Try to focus on the file format of mocap data. This project has used bvh file format since it is supported by Blender. Different 3D softwares support different types of formats for mocap data.</li></ol>The second folder contains bvh file for this project. The third folder contains rendered videos .</p>

<h2>IMPROVEMENTS</h2>
<p align="justify"> Although the character is responding to the mocap-data but aim was to make character walk. Some improvements might be made in the rig in the near future.
